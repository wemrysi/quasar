    * @param data A list of data sources to use in this test. The data will be loaded if
    *             not already loaded and deleted at the end of the test. Currently, the data is actually
    *             NOT deleted at the end of the test, but that is an undesired behavior that should hopefully
    *             be fixed in the future.
    *             Currently as well, the sources must have a non-empty [[String]] as a description
    *             in order for the fixture to derive a [[Path]] at which to store the data. Eventually, this path
    *             location could be randomized since we provide the paths as an argument for the body, so it should
    *             not hardcode any [[String]]s in theory. Under such circumstances, a [[DataSource]] with a empty string
    *             description would be accepted without issues.
    * @param runTests A function that accepts a path prefix under which both test
    *                 data may be found and tests may use as a sandbox, a backend
    *                 (filesystem) and an associated name for purposes of
    *                 identifying the backend in messages as well as a list of fully qualified paths to the test data
    *                 requested (in the same order as supplied)
