  * Specs2 trait helper that can be used to *write* new actuals that are usually
  * *read* and tested with `PendingWithActualTracking`. This trait is designed
  * to make writing these new actuals as easy as possible: all you have to do is
  * mix in this trait instead of `PendingWithActualTracking` and the test will
  * run all `pendingWithActual` specs in write mode instead.
  *
  * Note: Style of this code is adopted from specs2 (PendingUntilFixed.scala).
