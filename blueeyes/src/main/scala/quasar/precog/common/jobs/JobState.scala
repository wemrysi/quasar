/**
 * The Job state is used to keep track of the overall state of a Job. A Job is
 * put in a special initial state (`NotStarted`) when it is first created, and
 * is moved to the `Started` state once it gets its first status update. From
 * here it can either be `Cancelled` or put into one of several terminal
 * states. Once a job is in a terminal state, it can no longer be moved to a
 * new state.
