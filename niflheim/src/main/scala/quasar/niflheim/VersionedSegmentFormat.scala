/**
 * A `VersionedSegmentFormat` wraps formats and is used to deal with multiple
 * versions for `SegmentFormat`s. The version of a segment format is always
 * written first, followed by the actual segment. The format with the highest
 * version number is always used for writing. For reads, the version is read
 * first and the format corresponding to this version is used to read the rest
 * of the segment. If no format exists for that version, then we return an
 * error.
